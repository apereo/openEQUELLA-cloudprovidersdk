# openEQUELLA Cloud Provider SDK

Cloud Providers are a way to extend openEQUELLA without having to modify the core code. In addition to this, as the name suggests, the extensions can be hosted on external servers by third parties.

Currently the ways in which Cloud Providers can extend openEQUELLA are in just a few key areas:

- Contribution wizard controls
- Attachments and viewing them

TODO explain needing a server

In order to create a Cloud Provider which openEQUELLA users can register to use
